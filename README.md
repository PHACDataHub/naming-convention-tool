# naming-convention-tool
A tool that takes a project name and returns a name based on our cloud naming conventions. This tool is based on the naming conventions used internally and can be found here: https://github.com/PHACDataHub/Wiki/wiki/Project-ID-Naming-Standard

This tool is a work in progress and is no where near its final iteration.
